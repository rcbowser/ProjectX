# ProjectX

Challenge
Your challenge for this milestone is to create a meme generation app using UIImagePickerController, UIAlertController, and Core Graphics. If you aren’t familiar with them, memes are a simple format that shows a picture with one line of text overlaid at the top and another overlaid at the bottom.

Your app should:

Prompt the user to import a photo from their photo library.
Show an alert with a text field asking them to insert a line of text for the top of the meme.
Show a second alert for the bottom of the meme.
Render their image plus both pieces of text into one finished UIImage using Core Graphics.
Let them share that result using UIActivityViewController.
Both the top and bottom pieces of text should be optional; the user doesn’t need to provide them if they don’t want to.
